            <li>The Geographical  <br>
                    The Bermuda Triangle encompasses an area roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico. This triangular region spans approximately 500,000 square miles, making it an expansive and compelling subject of study. While the boundaries may vary slightly depending on different interpretations, the overall area remains constant.

                <li>Historical Disappearances:
                    One of the key factors that have contributed to the fame of the Bermuda Triangle are the numerous reported disappearances of ships and aircraft over the years. We delve into some of the most notable incidents, such as the mysterious disappearance of Flight 19 in 1945, where five U.S. Navy torpedo bombers vanished without a trace. Additionally, we examine the vanishing of the SS Marine Sulphur Queen in 1963 and the unsolved case of the USS Cyclops in 1918, among others. By examining these incidents, we aim to uncover patterns and potential explanations for these disappearances

                        Numerous theories have emerged over time to explain the phenomena occurring within the Bermuda Triangle. We discuss some of the most prevalent ones, including natural explanations such as unpredictable weather patterns, strong currents, and geological features. We also explore more controversial theories involving extraterrestrial activity, underwater civilizations, and the existence of a time-space warp. As we navigate through these theories, we evaluate the scientific evidence and consider the plausibility of each explanation.
